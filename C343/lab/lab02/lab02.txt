From example 1 to 6, I chose example 1. 
In the condition of for loop, 
we use counter++ after i = 0 and i++ to track runtime of n.
Since sum++ in the for loop is a constant step,
"counter++" is not needed to add after constant step.



For example 7,
In the both for loop condition, we use counter++
after i = 1, j = 1 and i++, j++ to track the runtime in for loop.
Then in the if statement in the for loop, we use counter++ as well
to track the runtime for a nonconstant code in for loop.
Last, get a min number within three numbers by using Math.min() twice.



For Example 1, n = 10   instructioncounter = 10   (instructioncounter / n) = 1
For Example 7, n = 10   instructioncounter = 210   (instructioncounter / n) = 21
For Example 1, n = 100   instructioncounter = 100   (instructioncounter / n) = 1
For Example 7, n = 100   instructioncounter = 20100   (instructioncounter / n) = 201
For Example 1, n = 1000   instructioncounter = 1000   (instructioncounter / n) = 1
For Example 7, n = 1000   instructioncounter = 2001000   (instructioncounter / n) = 2001
