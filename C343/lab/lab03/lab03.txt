Task A;

MyCard should contain a arraylist of String named deck such like {"C1", "H3", ....}.
For initialize() method, I used a for loop in a for loop and lists of numbers(1-13) and strings(C,S,H,D)
to add a new String named card to the deck I created first.
For String drawRandomCard() method, I used Random to get a random number within 0 to 51 to get a random card from the deck.
And I added a getdeck() method to get the whole deck for testing.


Task B;

A Tweet contains a name:String and content:String.
method printContent() print out the content of a tweet by using printing out this.content
method contain(String a) get the content of a tweet by using this.content, then I used the 
build in method boolean contains() to compare String a and String content. Output is a boolean.
