For the non-recusive flood(), there are three conditions we need to
consider if we should add the neighboring cells of each coord in floodlist.
First check if the neighboring cells are on the gaming board. Second, check if
the neighboring cells are in the floodlist or not. Third, if the colors of 
neighboring cells is same as the changing color. The neighboring cells that are
satisfied with all three conditions will be added to the floodlist.
This non-recusive flood() has a clear algorithm. It will visit every coord in the
floodlist.


For recusive flood(), the method will stop when the color of coord at (x,y) is not
the flooded color. It does not check if the coord is on the board or if the coord
is already in the floodlist. So we may end up with same coord in the floodlist which
we will waste spaces in the list. Both of them will need to visit every coord in the
floodlist.
