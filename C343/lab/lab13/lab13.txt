What can you state about the relative values of k (the largest key value) and n (the number of records)
 for the counting sort to be effective?

When k < n, the method of counting sort will be more effective since the runtime of it will be n.
If k > n, the method of counting sort will be less effective since the runtime of it will be k which k > n.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If k > n, what is the asymptotic running time of the counting sort algorithm?

The asymptotic running time is O(k).

If k < n, what is the asymptotic running time of the counting sort algorithm?

The asymptotic running time is O(n).
