    # In the autograder error mrssage provide the move that you made, plus a list of 
    # acceptable moves. So you should run this until you return an item in that list.
    # Note that it's VERY important you copy the hash from the error message! 
    # Otherwise, the results will mean nothing!

    # Note that this doesn't actually make the move! You will have to call board.makeMove to do that,
    # but this shouldn't be too important for debugging using the info we provide.
