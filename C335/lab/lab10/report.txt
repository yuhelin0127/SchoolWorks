Difficulties

1. Pick if or while loop for user_btn_read in systick to change the hz of the light led
2. Reading the pages that explain the getchar and putchar for transmittor and receivor for uart


What did you learn
1. Reflesh how a queue work - queue is empty when head = tail etc..
2. How interupt work in the system and how the handler works with it - when a handler runs, disable the interupt state
and when the interupt ends, enable the interupt state for uart to detect any interuptions
