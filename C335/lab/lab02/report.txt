Results:
1. Successfully complie and run my own make c.file
2. Successfully complie and run poly.c and dump.c
3. Complete my own version of dump memory in dump.c

Difficulties:
1. understand the ploy.c and dump.c , since the memory use and address are confusing in c
2. write my own dump.c, since the elements that are printed are many

What did I learn:
1. How many bytes of some type such as char, short, integer, float, and double in c
2. How to use %d %0hd %ld %0x %c %s %p %-f %+e and other % symbol to present our data.
