Q1. We are setting up for SD card. And theasynchronous communication needs the high state
    for sending data and recieve data in low state with clocks in SPI.

Q2. I can put *f3d_delay_uS()* function into a while loop to replace delay. Using a timer
    over a delay loop can have higher accuracy because the real delay in the loop of delay
    can be different in diferent situations.

Q3. Because the processor execute one data once time, and DMA can help the processor to
    assign efficiently tasks. By the way, it could improve the performance.

Q4. FAT locates the file in the SD. The corruption of an entry in the table could lead parts
    of a file to be lost if two different files are in a same location.

Q5. FAT16 limits the 512 entries, and FAT32 does not limit the number of entries.

The difficulty for me is figuring out DMA working. And I learned how to using DMA to improve
my image display performance.
