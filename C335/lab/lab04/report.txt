4. Why do we need newlib_stubs? Specifically, is there a reason that printf() won't work on the board without it?
Because Newlib_stubs provide a more full-featured printf() to us. If we do not use the newlib_stubs, the data that
we transfer to the board cannot prevent the library from buffing I/O.

5. Give an example of a situation in which the Salae Logic Analyzer is the best debugging method and include a screen shot of the Logic application.
If our program does not work well, the Salae Logic Analyzer can detect the input and display it to us.
