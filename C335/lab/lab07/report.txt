Question 1

    It has 14 pins
    pins	names
    1		Vdd_I0
    2		SCL
    3		SDA
    4		INT2
    5		INT1
    6		C1
    7		GND
    8		Reserved
    9		DRDY
    10		Reserved
    11		Reserved
    12		SETP
    13		SETC
    14		Vdd
    
	The accelerometer/magnetometer is sitting on the right of the center of STM board,
	it is a rectangle chip.
    2.5 vdd are required to power the accelerometer/magnetometer

Question 2
    
	Since we need to set up and update the accelerometer/magnetometer data continuously.
    following lines of codes are initializing the accelerometer and magnetometer data
	so that there is no need to read it first then write on it.
	
Question 3

    The following lines of codes are looping three times for all axis, x, y and z. It does the
    bit shift left by 8 and divides the result by 16, then it stores the result into the raw_data
    set. And it casts the raw_data to float and divides the raw_data by 1000.

Question 4

    Since while we are moving the board, the compass data is changing constantly all the time, if
    we do not tilt compensate our compass computation and track it all the time, the value in 
	the data would change in positive and negative.
	
Diffculties

    Compass visualization is the most complex and taxing task in lab7. Because we have to figure out
	how to use the trigonometric function and modify to match different heading angle values.
	
What I have learned
    
	I have learned how to get pitch and roll value and how the common compass works in devices.
