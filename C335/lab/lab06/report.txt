1. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of printf() debugging? Note: there is no right answer to this, we are just looking for your thoughts on the issue
   The advantage is that it is easier to see and figure out simple errors when we run the program.
   The disadvantage is that it is hard for me to find out the where goes wrong if the printf() runs for many times.
2. Explain why the spiReadWrite function is called inside a higher level peripheral function (the lcdWrite function).
   Because its purpose is configuring the peripheral with LCD screen.
3. Why does LCD_CS_DEASSERT() do? Why is it important?
   LCD_CS_DEASSERT() deassert the CS signal when it starts to interact with the board.
4. Explain how the character data from the ASCII array in glcdfont.c gets converted to pixels.
   Creating the array of unsigned characters in eight bits length firstly, then collecting the 
   chunks for drawing on the corresponding coordinates.
5. Give the exact timing difference between the two versions of f3d_lcd_fillScreen, from the Salae analyzer, and explain why the new function is faster.
   42 microseconds. The new function is faster because it stores the previse color and mared it with width. So it is faster  to get the color fill again with width.

Difficulty

The difficulty for me was to initate the lcd so that the lcd works.
