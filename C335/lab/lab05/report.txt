1. What does the CS pin do (the CS pin is called SS in the lab manual)?
   CS pin accesses the slaves and use slaves to send and receive data.

2. Why do you set the CS high at the end of the pin initializations? What other functions in f3d_gyro.c change CS from low to high, or from high to low?
   Because you want to make sure the CS will match the pin at the begining and end of read and write.
   f3d_gyro_read and f3d_gyro_write in f3d_gyro.c change CS from low to high, and high to low.
3. How do you hook up multiple peripherals on one SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) bus?
   We set each slave to low and set the slave I use next to high, because we can only activate slaves once through SPI bus
4. The STM has an Operating Frequency of 72 MHz. When initializing SPI1, what do you set the baud rate prescaler to? What is the resulting SPI clock frequency?
   Baud rate prescaler: fast - 6, medium - 24, slow - 180. 
   The resulting SPI clock frequency is 8MHz.
5. Does a peripheral ("Slave") need to be configured with the transmission speed before it can communicate with the microcontroler ("Master")? Why would you want to be able to do on-the-fly changes in transmission speed?
   Yes, since SPI bus can contain multiple slaves with different speeds.
   
What I learned:
GDB to help debugginig and how it accesses the functions within your code.

What the difficulty:
The major difficulty is that we have to make sure how to use a delay function and getchar to print out the right x,y,z axis
in main.c
