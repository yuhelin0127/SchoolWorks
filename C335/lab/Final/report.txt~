My task

(1) Draw the basic UI for Start Scene

Technical challenge: Most of the works are easy.

For UI, I will stay the same. Because UI is quite easy.

(2) Programing the transfer scene function

Technical challenge:  The difficult part for me is to provide boolean that can help only draw the scene once if the scene is not changed or there is nothing happen to the current scene.

For scene, I would like to put the changing scene into a function so that my code will be easier to read for my partner.

(3) Programing the f3d_led to show the health of player1 and player2

Technical challenge: The difficult part for me is to put the track health function into the right place in the game scene. So that the led lights for health will show the right health info on the board

I would still use the led to present the health of the players because it is easy to easy those with bright colors

(4) Progrmaing the player2 movment and shooting function by using keybroad inputs

Technical challenge: The movment of the player by tracking the getchar() from uart is quite useful. Declare a char to store getchar() is necessary. For shooting function, detecting get shoot function is the most difficult one because we have to tested it for many times to find the right x and y axis to declare the hit box for both players

I was using a for loop in the while loop to shoot when players shoot. But the downside is that by using a for loop, players cannot move when they shoot. So, we decide to using the while loop in the way of making change of y axis of the bullet to make the bullets move so that the players can also move when there are bullets moving in the scene.
