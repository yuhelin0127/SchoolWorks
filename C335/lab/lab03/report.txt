1. What are specs of the board you are using (ex. Speed, RAM, Flash)?
RAM, Speed, Flash, Leds, user button, and processor.

2. What does GPIO stand for?
"General Purpose Input/Output".

3. Is the provided delay function accurate? This delay function does not have a parameter!
Yes, the delay function works accurately in my while loop.

4. What are the Port and Pin Numbers of the two Green LEDs?
Two Green LEDs use Port E, and one Pin# is 11 and another is 15

5. What are the public attributes of the GPIO_InitTypeDef Struct?
The public attributes are: uint32_t GPIO_Pin GPIOMode_TypeDef GPIO_Mode GPIOSpeed_TypeDef GPIO_Speed GPIOOType_TypeDef GPIO_OType GPIOPuPd_TypeDef GPIO_PuPd

Difficulties
1. Setting up the environment takes a long time to do
2. Understanding the code of initiating the led and button

What did I learn?
I learned how to download and complie my c file that can work on a board!
