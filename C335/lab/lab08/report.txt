Q1. Since nunchuk uses I2C to get all the info, so there is no need to initialize the pins

Q2. f3d_i2c1_read_nunchuk() does not have to check inputs. If the multiple bytes were involved in the transfer

Q3. unsigned char jx;	// x axis of bar(0 to 255)
    unsigned char jy;	// y axis of bar(0 to 255)
    unsigned short ax;	// x axis of analog 
    unsigned short ay;	// y axis of analog
    unsigned short az;	// z axis of analog 
    unsigned char c;	// c button(0 or 1)
    unsigned char z;	// z button(0 or 1)
	
Q4. For case that equal to 2, only z button is pressed
    For case that equal to 1, only c button is pressed
    For case that equal to 0, both of buttons are pressed
    For case that equal to 3, no button is pressed
	
Difficulty
The main difficulty I had was to set all the initializations well and set the displays switch circlely

What I have learned
I have learned that the infomation we need to display all the variables we track should be read and write all the time,
and we need to update before we switch to another display to show other variables
